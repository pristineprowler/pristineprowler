i fucking hate pops maellard. he is the ugliest, most unintelligent creation to ever make contact with my eyeballs. the audacity jg quintel has, creating such a mistake of a character. like, who even thought this was a good idea? his design is terrible; that big head of his makes it impossible for him to balance. hes like an asymmetrical plane--his only destiny is to crash. fuck you. i hope you crash and take your ugly gumball machine with you. both of you can just die. in seperate incidents. i dont want you to have the comfort of dying together. you dont deserve any love from anybody. i smiled so wide during the finale, i completely ignored all the shitty writing that had no tie in you being the creator of the universe or whatever. i was just glad you died. i wouldnt have to see you again. then i watched the movie, you were there again... fuck. what does it take for you to stop creating plot holes, you inconsiderate bastard? i can think of one major plot hole of the top of my head, but no one cares. why? because no one cares about you, pops maellard. to you, i say: middle finger. go stick it up your ass. matter of fact i hope when the show gets a reboot it begins with you getting ran over by a golf cart. then id actually watch it.

just kidding! awwwwweeeee :heart: i love youuuuuuu
